# Q

**Introduction**

The purpose of this project is to maintain a set of plain language questions or queries that enable the validation
of an information model used for managing built assets, such as trees, rivers, buildings and doors and so on.

**Core Concept**

The goal of this project is to create a set of queries that can be used to validate the quality and accuracy of an
information model for managing built assets. This will enable organizations to better manage their assets, make
informed decisions, and improve overall efficiency.

**Examples of Fundamental Queries**

* What are the different types of assets we have?
* How many assets do we have in total?
* Can you provide a list of specific assets with their corresponding details?
* Are there any duplicate or redundant assets that need to be consolidated or removed?

These fundamental questions form the basis for more specific queries, such as:

* What are the top 5 most common types of buildings we operate?
* How many fire doors do we have in each zone?
* What is the average age of our runway assets?

**Example Use Case**

Tracking what data can answer each question from an organisation data catalogue enables the monitoring of the known
knowns and unknown knowns with respect to the curent information model being queried. For example:

"How many buildings do we manage, operate and maintain?"

This is a simple exercise of tying up the catalogued data vs the question, once this reconciliation has been completed,
the Client can be satisfied that
this PLQ can be answered.

A "known known" for the organisation.

If the question cannot be reconciled or answered with the current information available, this becomes a "known unknown".
Enabling the organisation to fulfil this gap.

# Wider integration

Q exists within the wider QuCaR model for the Reference Data Library. This model developed by INFENG forms the basis for
managing Queries, Catalogue and Requirements for information.

This is a voluntary project to support the advancement of the United Kingdom's approach to information management.
